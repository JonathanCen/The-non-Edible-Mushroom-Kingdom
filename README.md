# The non-Edible Mushroom Kingdom üçÑ

The non-Edible Mushroom Kingdom is my analysis and findings on [UCI Machine Learning Mushroom Classification dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/mushroom-classification) and machine learning models that would best predict whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous. The various models I trained on this dataset were decision trees (entropy and gini index), random forest (entropy and gini index), and naive Bayes. Utilized k-fold cross-validation to estimate the generalization of each model on a limited subset of the training data and graphviz to visualize various models to identify key features that help each model predict whether a mushroom is poisonous and edible.
